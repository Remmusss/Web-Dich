# Progress

## What Works
- Basic application structure with Next.js and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS integration for styling
- Main features component with card-based UI
- Feature categorization and filtering
- Search functionality with debounced input and text normalization
- Multiple language tool implementations (Translation, Dictionary, etc.)
- Financial tools (Currency Converter, Loan Calculator, etc.)
- Health tools (BMI Calculator, Workout Scheduler, etc.)
- Utility tools (Weather, QR Code, Time Zone Converter, etc.)
- Image processing tools:
  - Background removal (using client-side API)
  - Image cropping with rotation and scaling
- Language context with language switching
- Translation system with JSON files for English and Vietnamese
- React Icons integration for consistent iconography
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Page view tracking for popularity features

## What's Left to Build
- Additional language options beyond English and Vietnamese
- User authentication and personalized experiences
- Enhanced image processing features like filters and effects
- Data persistence for user preferences and settings
- Additional AI-powered tools
- Performance optimizations including lazy loading and code splitting
- Advanced caching strategies (SWR, React Query)
- Testing suite for components and utilities
- Accessibility improvements
- Dark mode support
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Backend API for more complex operations
- Mobile app wrappers (React Native)

## Current Status
The application is in active development with core functionality in place. The recent focus has been on expanding the image utilities with:
1. Background removal tool - Completed
2. Image cropping tool with rotation and scaling - Completed

The Features component serves as the main dashboard and organizes all available tools by category. The multilanguage system is functional with English and Vietnamese translations.

## Known Issues
- Page view tracking uses basic fetch approach instead of more efficient caching
- Some components may have incomplete translations
- Mobile responsiveness could be further improved for complex tools
- Performance optimizations needed for large file uploads
- No persistent storage for user preferences beyond language selection
- Image processing is limited to client-side capabilities
- Need to implement proper error handling for failed API requests

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. Initially started with a focus on translation tools and expanded to multiple categories
2. Added category-based organization for better user experience
3. Implemented multilanguage support early to ensure consistent internationalization
4. Chose client-side filtering for immediate user feedback during search
5. Decided to use react-image-crop for image manipulation rather than building custom solution
6. Added various utility features based on identified user needs
7. Kept consistent design language using Tailwind with card-based components
8. Implemented canvas-based image processing for client-side editing capabilities

## Completed Work
- Main Features component implementation
- Feature categorization and organization
- Search and filter functionality
- Basic page view tracking
- UI design with consistent card components
- Icon integration with React Icons
- Text normalization for search
- Modern minimalist dashboard UI implementation
- Mobile-responsive layout 
- Multilanguage system implementation with English and Vietnamese support
- Language switcher component with animated dropdown
- Context-based translation system
- Browser language detection and localStorage persistence
- Image background removal feature with API endpoint

## In Progress
- Implementing optimal caching strategy for page views (considering SWR)
- Building out individual feature pages
- API integrations for various utilities
- Expanding translation coverage to all components
- Integrating actual background removal service with external API

## Future Work
- Implement user authentication and personalization
- Add more AI-powered tools and utilities
- Optimize performance with server-side components
- Enhance analytics for better feature recommendations
- Implement user feedback mechanisms
- Add more language options beyond English and Vietnamese
- Create a translation management system for easier updates
- Integrate with professional background removal API services

## Technical Debt
- Multiple caching strategies are suggested but not implemented
- Client-side filtering may need to be moved to server-side for better performance
- Some features may need additional error handling and edge case management
- Translation system could benefit from more robust fallback mechanisms
- Background removal API is currently just a placeholder
