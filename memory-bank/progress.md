# Progress

## Completed Work
- Main Features component implementation
- Feature categorization and organization
- Search and filter functionality
- Basic page view tracking
- UI design with consistent card components
- Icon integration with Heroicons
- Text normalization for search

## In Progress
- Implementing optimal caching strategy for page views
- Building out individual feature pages
- API integrations for various utilities

## Known Issues
- The page view tracking is currently using a basic approach with suggested optimizations commented in the code
- Search functionality is client-side only, which may have performance implications with larger datasets

## Future Work
- Implement user authentication and personalization
- Add more AI-powered tools and utilities
- Optimize performance with server-side components
- Enhance analytics for better feature recommendations
- Implement user feedback mechanisms

## Technical Debt
- Multiple caching strategies are suggested but not implemented
- Client-side filtering may need to be moved to server-side for better performance
- Some features may need additional error handling and edge case management
