# Active Context

## Current Focus
The application is currently focused on the Features component, which acts as the main dashboard for displaying all available tools and utilities to users. This component organizes features into categories, provides search functionality, and highlights popular features based on page views.

## Recent Changes
- Implementation of the Features component with category filtering
- Search functionality with text normalization for better user experience
- Page view tracking and popular feature highlighting
- Multiple caching strategies for performance optimization

## Key Patterns and Preferences
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent design patterns
- Client-side filtering and search for immediate user feedback
- Category-based organization of features
- Popular/Hot badges for features with high page views

## Next Steps
1. Implement or optimize page view tracking with one of the suggested caching strategies
2. Consider server-side component approach for better performance
3. Continue development of individual feature pages
4. Potentially implement user authentication for personalized experiences
5. Add more AI-powered tools to the collection

## Active Decisions
- Currently using a basic fetch approach for page views with suggested alternatives
- Using client-side filtering for features with debounced search
- Organizing features into defined categories
- Implementing a consistent card-based UI for all features
