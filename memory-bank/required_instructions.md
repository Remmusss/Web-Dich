# Required Instructions

The following rules should always be followed in this project:

## UI Styling Guidelines
- Design a Modern Minimalist Dashboard UI for the project
- Prioritize clean layouts, soft colors, card-based components, and simple navigation
- Use clear typography, light icons, and subtle shadows
- Ensure the dashboard is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices with smooth adaptive layouts

## Color Scheme
- Use a monochromatic gray color palette throughout the application
- Primary buttons should use gray-600 background with white text
- Hover states should use gray-700 background
- DO NOT use blue colors for UI elements (bg-blue-*)
- Use bg-gray-50 to bg-gray-700 for all color gradients
- Active/selected elements should use gray-600 instead of blue-600
- Icons should be gray-500 in neutral state and gray-600 in active state

## Component Styling
- Card components should use rounded-xl corners with subtle shadows
- Interactive elements should use consistent hover effects with transition-colors
- Form elements should maintain clean, minimal appearance with gray-300 borders
- Use consistent padding and margin scales
- Maintain proper spacing between UI elements (gap-4 to gap-8)
- Typography should follow a clear hierarchy with gray-700/800 for headings
